# FieldCommander ⚔️

**A mobile-first, role-aware governance interface for sovereign AI systems**

FieldCommander is the control terminal for Divergent Assets — enabling secure, traceable, and compliant interaction with autonomous agents like ForecastAgent, Judith, and SecureSigner. Built with memory-bound capsule logic and anti-AGI governance at its core, FieldCommander enforces role separation, capsule ancestry, and EO14178-aligned transparency.

| 🌐 Stack              | Next.js, TailwindCSS, ShadCN UI, Vercel-ready                              |
| 🧠 Capsule Logic      | Supports memory-bound, role-restricted AI agents via Judith + Vaultkeeper  |
| 🔐 Secure Execution   | Integrates SecureSigner for private key protection + on-chain dispatch     |
| 📦 Agent Support      | ForecastAgent, Judith, SolidGrip, NeuroScope, RelayCortex                  |
| 📱 Mobile Priority     | Designed for biometric auth, offline fallback, and sovereign PWA command   |

## 🚀 What It Does

- Dispatch commands to ForecastAgent, Judith, SolidGrip
- View agent roles, memory state, task status, capsule ROI
- Launch secure on-chain trades, AI forecasts, and governance proposals
- Trace every interaction to capsule + signer lineage

FieldCommander is **not a frontend.** It's a memory-aware governance stack for recursive, role-bound AI systems.
